## üí° What is this App?

The **Heart Disease Predictor App** is a machine learning-powered tool that predicts the probability of heart disease based on clinical parameters such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. The app uses a Logistic Regression model trained on the **Heart Disease Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This app is designed to:
- Provide personalized risk assessments.
- Explain predictions using SHAP values.
- Visualize feature importance.
- Offer actionable health tips based on the user's risk level.

## üåü Why is this App Useful?

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and risk assessment can significantly improve outcomes. This app helps users:
- Assess their risk of heart disease in minutes.
- Understand which factors contribute most to their risk.
- Get actionable advice to improve their health.

It is intended for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice.

## üîß How Does It Work?

The app uses a pre-trained Logistic Regression model to predict the probability of heart disease. Here‚Äôs how it works:
1. Users input their medical attributes (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure).
2. The app processes the inputs and calculates the probability of heart disease.
3. Results are displayed with:
   - A risk level (Low, Medium, High).
   - SHAP explanations to show feature contributions.
   - Feature importance visualization.
   - Health tips and gamification badges.

## üß† Model Training and Data Analysis

### Overview
The model was trained using the **Heart Disease Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Below is a summary of the steps I followed to build the model:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., `sex`, `cp`, `thal`) into numerical values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed distributions of key features like `age`, `chol`, and `trestbps`.
   - Visualized correlations between features using heatmaps and pair plots.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Used statistical methods (e.g., correlation matrix, feature importance from Random Forest) to identify the most impactful features.
   - Selected features like `age`, `sex`, `cp`, `trestbps`, `chol`, `thalach`, and `oldpeak`.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Trained a Logistic Regression model due to its simplicity and interpretability.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).
   - Achieved an accuracy of **85%** and an F1-score of **86%**.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
   - Used SHAP values to explain the model‚Äôs predictions.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Saved the trained model as `heart_disease_model.pkl` using `pickle`.
   - Integrated the model into the Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
